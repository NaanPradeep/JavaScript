Given a 
string, str and an
integer, n and an
integer, startPos.

Write a fuction which draw a Hexagon.

n should be a multiple of 6.
n should be between 1 & 60.

Length of the string should be less than or equal to n. 
If the string length is less than n, then str[(n - str.length)] to str[n] should be  "*".

For example, if  
str = "abcdefgh";
n = 12;
startPos = 3;

Output should look like below,
	    d  
	  e   c
	f       b
	g       a -----> startPos - 3
	h       *
	  *   *
	    *  

if str = "abcd";
   n = 6;
   startPos = 2;


	  c  
	d   b
	*   a ----> startPos - 2
	  *
